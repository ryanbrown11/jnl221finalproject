        <h1>Aid to Ukraine: How Much is Too Much?</h1>
        <p>By Ryan Brown</p>

      <p>As the war in Ukraine goes into its second year, both sides are losing men, materiel, and money on a massive scale. Russia has lost 10,000 armored vehicles including 3,000 tanks since the start of the invasion in 2022, according to the United Kingdom’s Minister of State for the Armed Forces Leo Docherty. Ukraine has lost a similar amount of equipment, yet unlike Russia, Kyiv has been the recipient of numerous military and financial aid packages from countries across the globe in an effort to support its defense.</p>

      <p>A substantial number of the aid given to Ukraine comes from the United States, which recently overcame a seven month long internal battle over doling out more aid to the war-torn country. Even before this, many hard-line Republicans in Congress believed that the US had done enough and that it was time to stop giving out so much money to Ukraine. Now, this view will only be amplified after the $95 billion aid package was finalized.</p> 
        
        <p>That assistance, however, will likely only last until the end of the year. As the United States presidential elections loom later this year, it's possible that the very fate of Ukraine will be decided in November if former President Donald Trump, a vocal critic of aid to Ukraine, succeeds in getting elected once more. With the stakes this high, it’s imperative that the world has a clear picture of what U.S. aid to Ukraine actually looks like and how it compares to other countries.

      <p class="caption">Total Financial Aid for Ukraine</p>

      <p>As the data shows, from February 2022 to January 2024, most financial aid to Ukraine came from Europe. The total contributions of European countries and the European Union far outweighed the amount of aid provided by the United States. The contribution of European Union Institutions in particular stand out, as they total €77.2 billion. These commitments from the European Union mainly stem from the European Investment Bank, but also includes the European Commission and the European Council. 
      </p>

      <p>From the start of Russia’s invasion, the European Union rallied behind Ukraine to pass funding for the country. In less than a month after the invasion, the European Union rallied to not only sanction but provide billions of Euros to Ukraine as European leaders “condemned in the strongest possible terms the Russian Federation’s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine.”
      </p>

      <p>The United States too was quick to respond, providing €5.8 billion to Ukraine in 2022 alone. Since then of course, that number has more than quadrupled. While it is certainly clear that the United States is the country which provides the most financial aid to Ukraine, this must be interpreted with the knowledge of the country’s importance to the United States’ interests in the region. 
      </p>

      <p>Patrick Alvarez, a former US Army National Guard intelligence analyst, believes that the future of Europe and the United States’ role on the continent is heavily tied to the war that Ukraine is currently in the midst of. “I think one of the things that a lot of [Americans] may not get is how much we need Ukraine to hold back Russia,” said Alvarez. “If we let Ukraine fall, what type of message does that send to the rest of the world? We need to keep supporting our allies in the region, or else Russia will just continue to roll through Europe.”

      <p class="caption">Total Military Aid for Ukraine</p>

      <p>Financial aid is just one, albeit key, aspect of assistance to Ukraine. Perhaps just as important are the actual military materiel commitments being sent to the Ukrainians by their allies. All told, €101.93 billion has been given to Ukraine as of January 2024 to bolster the country’s military. 
      </p>

      <p>The importance of that aid cannot be understated, as it was recently reported that even during the seven month hiatus of American aid, the Ukrainian front lines were increasingly being pushed eastward and the country was struggling to get equipment to its soldiers to withstand the recent Russian offensives. Leading the way with €42.22 billion of aid provided, the American aid has been some of the most pivotal for the Ukranians as the country relies heavily on the howitzers and armored vehicles provided by the United States.
      </p>

      <p>“Most of this military aid was essentially just given as a handout to the Ukranians, but now with the pushback in Congress it’s going to become a loan that they may have to pay back whenever the war ends,” Alvarez said. The military aid has indeed been restructured into forgivable loans that the Ukranians may or may not have to pay back to the United States in the future, but it will still allow for the country to maintain its fight into next year. 
      </p>

      <p>This data shows yet again that EU Institutions' commitments trump the amount provided by the Americans. In total, the EU has provided €126.87 billion in both financial and military aid to Ukraine, a number that has continued to grow since this past January. In light of this, perhaps it's time for Americans to ask themselves another question: “is America doing too little?”
